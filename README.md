## How to Use This Repository

Each day has its own Markdown file with explanations and code examples. You can read through the content directly on GitHub. To run the Python code, you'll need a Python environment (you can use online platforms like Google Colab).  The Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive way to run the code.
